NAME
    CogBase - A CogBase Implementation in Perl

WARNING
    This Database implementation is in its infancy. Just barely a proof of
    concept so far. It would be ridiculous of you to use it for anything
    serious, yet.

SYNOPSIS
        use CogBase;

        my $conn = CogBase->connect('http://cog.example.com');

        my $schema = $conn->node('Schema');
        $schema->value(<<'...');
        +: person
        <: Node
        age: Number
        given_name: String
        family_name: String
        ...
        $conn->store($schema);

        my $person = $conn->node('person');

        $person->given_name('Ingy');
        $person->family_name('dot Net');
        $person->age(42);

        $conn->store($person);

        my @results = $conn->query('!person');
        my @nodes = $conn->fetch(@results);

        for my $node (@nodes) {
            print "%s %s is %d years old\n",
                $node->given_name,
                $node->family_name,
                $node->age;
        }

        $conn->disconnect;

DESCRIPTION
    CogBase is a Object Database Management System.

    Some interesting characteristics of its design are:

    * All objects are stored as nodes.
    * Every node has a universally unique id.
    * Every node has a type.
    * Every type has a schema.
    * Every schema, is itself, a node in the db.
    * Every schema has a base/super schema that it inherits from.
    * Schemas can be used to generate programming language (Perl) classes
    for every type (schema) of node.
    * CogBase defines several core scalar types.
    * CogBase defines one core schema (that every schema inherits from).
    * Every node has one or more revisions.
    * Every revision is immutable.
    * Database access methods are connect, create, store, fetch, query and
    disconnect.
    * All nodes have access control based on the Unix File System.
    * HTTP is used for the network layer. GET and POST are used for all
    operations.
    * Database can be used over network or embedded.
    * Access control is based on Unix File System
